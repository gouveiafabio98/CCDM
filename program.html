                        <p>After working in London and Paris, Katja Schloz started out her own design studio for visual communication based in Stuttgart, Germany. With her great passion in design, her strong focus on typography and the ruthless belief in
                            simplicity, Katja Schloz develops visual identities, brand concepts, books and publications. Using exceptional typographic concepts, she create contemporary design solutions to add value to the reach of businesses, cultural
                            institutions and international artists. (Her claim and her passion is to open brands with new ways of thinking – to think broader and bigger, to make identities visible and tangible, and to shape culture intelligently.) She
                            works internationally with clients like Nike, CEAAC Strasbourg, University Basel, DIE ZEIT in Hamburg and more locally with institutions like „Die Staatstheater Stuttgart“, Lange Nacht der Museen Stuttgart, Landesmuseum Württemberg.

                        <p>Based in the German city of Hamburg, Tobias Wüstefeld is an illustrator who loves creating miniature worlds. Each has its own look, emotion and general atmosphere, and is full of detail for the viewer to inspect and engage with.
                            Sometimes, these worlds are brought to life in his animation work. Currently he experiments with using VR as a tool for creating this worlds. In his opinion with this new ways of working, new ways of seeing and new styles will
                            emerge. With VR a new way of experimental approach comes into the work of Designers.</p>

                        <p>Ece Canlı is a design researcher, artist and musician, born and raised in Turkey and based in Portugal. She holds a Ph.D. from Design at University of Porto (Portugal) and an MFA in Experience Design at Konstfack University College
                            of Arts, Crafts and Design (Sweden). Her tools of investigation include texts, voice, sound and artefacts. Her academic work sits at the intersection of decolonial queer feminist epistemologies, material regimes and body politics;
                            more specifically, socio-spatio-material constitutions of gender, sexuality, race and other identity categories. She is a founding member of the research collective Decolonising Design Group and currently researcher in CECS
                            (The Communication and Society Research Centre) at University of Minho, where she investigates spatial, material and technological conditions of queer incarceration. In her artistic and vocal practice, she explores counterfactual
                            narrativity, corporal and mental delinking, and extralinguistic expressions through extended vocal techniques. She currently composes and performs in music collectives including NOOITO and COBRA’CORAL, as well as in her solo
                            project VOX FLORA, VOX FAUNA, while continuing to create and perform as a soloist.</p>

                            to explore conjunctions and disjunctions resulting from the convergence of, at least, two distinct modalities of simulation — namely top-down and bottom-up approaches — at the core of computational artistic practices. As a
                            chapter on such ongoing research, his latest work has been addressing vocal synthesis and manipulation technologies as retro bioengineering tactics responsible for rendering new body diagrams.</p>
